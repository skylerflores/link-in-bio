#This is first state website in codespace: link-in-bio

My link-in-bio gives you access to check out my GitHub, LinkedIn, X, and my Instagram profiles.
Also you'll find links to a very helpful TedTalk, one of my favorite study music playlist,
and an article about my favorite director Wes Craven.

Open this repository in a GitHub Codespace or acces through my Render site,
